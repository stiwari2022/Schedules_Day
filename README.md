Just make something that looks like the form attached

Also, run pip install fpdf and pip install pandas (or for other computers pip3 install fpdf and pip3 install pandas)

Go to classes.csv and fill in the class names/presenters based on what will be there on seminar day

Fill in the variabes cap, max_classes, and lunch in Reading.py. The variable cap should be the most amount of students in each class, aka class capacities. max_classes is the amount of classes/periods in the schedule. Lunch is a boolean (True or False) where if you enter True, then half the students will have lunch right before their last period, and the other half of students will have lunch right before their second last period. If its set to False, then there'll be no lunch factored in.

Look at the screen shot for reference on how to format your form, you must put name and then grade as the first two, after that just put multiple choices of the classes/presenters
